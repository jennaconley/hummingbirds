Hummingbird Trip Planner:
A website that allows people to plan trips to see hummingbirds by searching for reported sightings of one or more species of
hummingbirds using eBird data from the eBird API (species, date reported, location of report). I'd like to allow users to search
for areas of maximum reported hummingbird species diversity, and to limit their searches to certain weeks/months, since some species are
migratory.
I would ideally like to return the results to the user visually, possibly using Mapbox. If possible, I'd also like to build a Hummingbird alert feature that sends text or email alerts, especially the first time each calendar year a species is reported near a user-specified location. 

Minimum Viable Project:
A website that displays a list of hummingbird sightings, including species, date/time, and location.
